                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">I had a conversation with someone less than a week before my dad died. I expressed my deep wish to be able to have those memories more typical to a father-daughter relationship. As the conversation continued, I came to realize that more than those &quot;typical memories,&quot; I wanted to have memories which illustrated who my father was.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I was in California when my dad passed away. The flight back to Newark allowed a respite from the tumult of hearing the horrible news, packing, and making my way to the airport. I lay down in the empty three seater I was in, and the great roar of the engine faded as my mind was flooded with memories.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">My dad had a mischievous silliness I've seen matched by no one else. Everyone in our family, and probably most of the people in his professional life, have been witness to it at some point. He has a few staple pranks that he's pulled on the kids of the family. When he still had all the toes on his right foot, he used to be a master at &quot;toe-pinching.&quot; Small children would run in terror! If you were sitting on the floor in front of the couch while he was watching TV, beware, for you were liable to get pinched. He also utilized the well known, and greatly feared, boogie monster myth. That story did a good job of keeping me from &quot;running away&quot; - &quot;Who's going to protect you from the boogie monster if you run away?&quot; he'd ask. He was always a teaser at the dinner table, whether it be the topics of conversation, or the &quot;food grabbing finger creature&quot; which would roam the table looking for morsels of cookie or other scrumptious food which was being guarded by a very alert toddler.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">When I was born, my parents were astounded, because there sat a newborn who looked like a replica of my father. Not only have I inherited my father's looks, but I have inherited his temperament. This became especially apparent whenever we had an argument. We were both stubborn, and sometimes were unable to let go of our initial stance. This caused us to have some fights which in hindsight were quite ridiculous. The conflict which comes to mind most frequently began in what the family has dubbed &quot;the pigsty&quot; - it's our computer room. I was sitting in front of the computer procrastinating and my dad came upstairs and wanted to use it to type up a letter. I was quickly jolted into remembering what I had to research and insisted I be allowed to continue using the computer. My dad saw the game on the screen and didn't believe that I'd actually work - he was probably right. Anyway, we launched into an argument that escalated to such a point that we were both so irritated that we pretty much wanted to attack each other. In an expression of our frustration we both started to slap each other lightly gegenseitig on the arms. We must have looked ridiculous sitting there with scowls on our faces and lightly swatting each other. What is so wonderful about this, is that both of us, even in our rage, did not want to bring harm to the other, for our love for one another was much stronger than the anger we felt.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">My dad never lost the child within. Though he was deeply involved and interested in much more serious matters, he still very much enjoyed being a part of the simpler, more carefree ways of a child. Three years ago, my dad and I discovered a miniature version of those round, plastic buckets often used by kids for trick-or-treating. This miniature version looked like a cartoon of Dracula's head. My dad kept in his room on a dresser. After a couple of days I noticed that it had disappeared. I inquired as to where the Dracula had gone. He looked at me with his &quot;look of innocence&quot; and replied &quot;what Dracula?&quot; &quot;Dad, where's the Dracula?&quot; &quot;Oh, no where, it's well taken care of.&quot; &quot;Dad...&quot; &quot;Hmmm?&quot; &quot;Dad...&quot; Finally, after a lot of haggling and great proclamations of innocence, he let slip: &quot;Well, you might check around your room a bit.&quot; So I sprinted off to my room and searched around and finally found the Dracula, sitting, hidden behind a book, on my bookshelf. I wandered back downstairs and into my dad's room. He looked up to me expectantly and I tried my best to keep an oblivious look on my face. Eventually he asked, &quot;Well?&quot; &quot;Well, what?&quot; &quot;Was he there?&quot; &quot;Maybe.&quot; He looked at me, &quot;Well, I've known him to run off every once in a while, I just thought you should check you room cause I noticed his black handle disappearing behind the door as I came upstairs. You sure he's not there?&quot; &quot;He might be.&quot; &quot;He must be there.&quot; The &quot;look of innocence&quot; now started to wander across my face. &quot;You think I, of all people, wouldn't tell you if I saw him?&quot; I asked. &quot;Well, actually, yes.&quot; came the reply with a smile. The next day, when I came home from school, my dad was working, and therefore not in his room. I ran up to my room, snatched the Dracula and ran back into his room. I stood in the middle of the room and looked for a perfect hiding place. Ah! Under the bed! Behind one of those old boxes! So I quickly hid the Dracula and went upstairs to do some homework. My dad came back home for dinner and I decided to make him aware of the visitor in his room. &quot;You know, I've noticed a lot of bats in these parts. Do you know if they're vampire bats, Dad?&quot; A knowing look flashed across my dad's face. &quot;I don't know, I'm a little worried that they might actually be vampires in disguise. I certainly wouldn't want any vampire roaming around these parts.&quot; I replied, &quot;Yeah, I mean, I know I wouldn't want to be sleeping with a vampire in my room.&quot; Both of us grinned. That evening I went out to the library to get some books and when I came home, my dad was back in his room. I went in, &quot;Hey, Dad, you think you're gonna sleep well tonight?&quot; He replied, &quot;Yep.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; &quot;Mhm. But how are you going to sleep?&quot; A devious smile appeared on his face, which quickly melted back into the familiar look of innocence. I quickly ran up to my room and searched and searched and finally came upon the Dracula, nicely hidden among my stuffed animals. And the cycle continued.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Someone once said &quot;a man who takes himself too seriously is seldom a great man.&quot; My father was certainly able to laugh at himself. He loved making fun of his status as a senior citizen. He had a favorite joke for when our family was preparing to go to more formal events. He would wait in the kitchen until my mom came downstairs and then, with a twinkle in his eye, he would quickly pull up the waist of his pants as far as possible, slouch, and pull one of the tails of his shirt out of his pants, making him look older and rather silly, and he would stare innocently at my mother. When she said something, or gave him a reproachful look, he'd make some loud comments about how she was limiting his senior rights or that she was discriminating against him because of his age.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Just this past Christmas I was in Germany to celebrate. On January 3rd when I returned to the US, my dad was admitted to the hospital (he came home a week later). When I came into the hospital room that day he joked: &quot;You know, you were getting all the attention today, coming in from Germany and all. I mean, Mom was going to leave me all alone at home to go to the airport to pick you up. I definitely didn't appreciate the spot light not being on me, so I decided to go to the hospital.&quot; I wish he were here now so that I could joke with him about how he just pulled the biggest attention-getting stunt possible.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">My dad had a talent for making puns unlike any I've seen or heard before. For anyone who hears a lot of puns, you know that the worse they are, the more they make you groan, the better they are. At dinner Dad would be on a roll with puns. I retaliated by teasing him or hitting him lightly on the back of the head. He would immediately launch into: &quot;SENIOR ABUSE! SENIOR ABUSE! CALL THE AUTHORITIES! SENIOR ABUSE! Do you see this Elisabeth? You're witness to this abuse! SENIOR ABUSE!&quot; Usually this wouldn't work, and I would continue to poke him and prod at him. Then he would quickly switch his tactic and started to use what he dubbed the &quot;geezer voice&quot; - a raspy, squeaky voice which he used to further complain about the harsh life of a senior with a teenage daughter.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">My favorite memory of my dad was in the summer of 2000. He was admitted to the hospital for life-threatening ischemia in his colon. My mother and I didn't know if he was going to live or die. I pulled a checkered brown shirt out from his closet and wore it everyday. When I came into the hospital wearing it, he immediately said &quot;Talk about stealing the shirt off a man's back.&quot; Even in his pain and worry he could still have a laugh. The clot cleared up and he came home from the hospital. I was still wearing the shirt though. My mom wanted to get rid of it because it is fairly worn out. My dad made the announcement that whoever gave him one dollar first would get the shirt. I sprinted up to my room, grabbed a buck, raced back downstairs, and shoved it in his hand. I got the shirt.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">While on the plane I came to realize that though I did have regret about not having more time with my dad, I did not regret having not made those more typical memories. I do have memories which illustrate who my father was, and though I deeply miss his humor, especially right now, I am very glad to have the memories of it and especially of the twinkle that was always in his eyes.<br /></p>
