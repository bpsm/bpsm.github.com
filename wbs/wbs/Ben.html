                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">The past few years have been anything but easy. One crisis seemingly followed another. As many of you may know, this past autumn was very painful. But it is not <span class="style">pain</span> I want to talk about today.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">What I want is to give you a glimpse of who my father is to me, and I'll begin with this past Autumn.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">The weeks and months following the breaking off of my planned marriage brought us closer together than we'd every been before. I could feel his love and support for me while I was still home. When I had returned to Austria, I'd call often with questions. I had many questions. He offered support and guidance. I'd find him in his home office on seemingly every day of the week and at most hours of the day. I didn't just call with questions. Sometimes I'd call because I couldn't fall asleep or to discuss the news or just to chew his ear off. I even worried that I might be calling too often and keeping him from his work. Now, standing here, I treasure each of those conversations, even the trivial ones.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I find I don't really have the words to express just how much it meant to me that he was there for me with love and council. It wasn't entirely like my father to be so open in this way, making it even more precious. It wasn't that long ago that I told him that I appreciated how supportive he'd been. I now wish I'd recognized it earlier and told him more often.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Sometimes when I'd call we would compare notes on our various ailments, shared and otherwise. He taught me through his example that the best way to approach such things was with <span class="style">resolve</span> and a <span class="style">mildly twisted</span> sense of humor. Did you know that a little humor even under the direst of circumstances can make it hurt just a little less? I learned that from him, and applied it again only a few days ago.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I think he kept his sense of humor as much for his own benefit as for that of his family because it allowed him to look beyond the gravity of his current situation and focus on living. Let me give you an example of this peculiar brand of humor.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I was a boy of perhaps nine years when my father returned from Columbia Presbyterian following a heart attack, a pulmonary embolism, and the loss of 5 toes. Now you might think that there's nothing very amusing about a foot full of gangrenous toes, <span class="style">but you'd be wrong.</span><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">My father, knowing that I was now armed with a reasonably certain grasp of the four basic arithmetic operations, came home bearing a word problem for me. And so he reported of himself:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">When daddy entered the hospital he weighed 200 pounds. When he left the hospital he weighed only 175 pounds. While he was there he lost five toes. <span class="style">How much did each toe weigh?</span><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I think I replied indignantly &quot;Daddy, you lost more than just your toes!&quot;<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">And so he tackled his twenty year battle with humor, strength and a determination to live. To truly live.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">The afternoon before his heart <span class="style">simply</span> <span class="style">halted</span> I talked with him on the phone. He was in good spirits, bragging wryly about how impressed everyone at the hospital was with his bladder capacity. He was happy to finally be rid of some of the water he'd accumulated in the weeks before. He was feeling better and had us all convinced that he'd once again dodged the bullet.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I find I can't be angry at him for leaving us so soon, though I do feel as If I've been somehow robbed. He dodged the bullet so often that it seems unfair to be too hard on him for the one time it didn't work out.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I've learned to try to search for something positive, or at least worth salvaging in even the most hopeless situations. I think I learned this from him as well and so I want to try to apply it:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I think he found the death he wished for, though certainly not at the time he would have wished for.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">He endured excruciating pain daily because he was determined to keep his legs. He feared the loss of independence he would suffer though amputation and so he hung on to them, long after many would have given up. <span class="style">He won this battle.</span> He kept is legs to the very end.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">He was able to work to his very last day. He needed to feel productive and useful. It was important to him as a person and it was important as a motivation to keep him going every day. Though he recognized the need to retire <span class="style">at some point</span>, or at least prepare for it, <span class="style">some day soon</span>, I don't think his heart was ever there.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">I feel blessed to have had him as a father. I feel fortunate to have had him for as long as I did and at the same time I feel a gaping hole in me that may never completely heal. Through his kindness, his good council, his support, his honesty, his generosity and his example there is a little bit of him in each and every one of us. I will carry my piece of him with me for as long as I may live. He will never truly be gone.<br /></p>
